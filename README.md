This repository contains some scripts that are helpful for preparing Illumina libraries.
# lib-prep-tools

## Instalation
`pip install git+https://github.com/kerrycobb/lib-prep-tools`

## Commands
### samplePrep
Calculate how much starting material and how much water/buffer are needed to achievve a desired nanomolar concentration and volume of DNA for sequencing.

Run `samplePrep --help` for guide to usage.

Illumina platforms typically require samples to be at 5 nanoMolar concentrations.

### dilutionCalc
Calculate how much starting material and how much water/buffer are needed to achieve a desired concentration and volume of DNA.

Run `dilutionCalc --help` for guide to usage.

### molToNg
Calculate the concentration of DNA needed to achieve a desired molarity.

Run `molarityCalc --help` for guide to usage.
