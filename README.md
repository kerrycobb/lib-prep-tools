This repository contains some scripts that are helpful for preparing Illumina libraries.

### `illumina_sample_prep.py`
Calculate how much a sample needs to be concentrated or diluted to achieve desired 
molarity. Run `illumina_sample_prep.py` for guide to usage.

### `dilutionCalc.py`
Calculate volume of water to add to sample to achieve desired concentration.
Run `dilutionCalc.py` for guied to usage.

### `molarityCalc.py`
Calculate minimum DNA concentration required to reach required molarity
Run `molarityCalc.py --help` for guide to usage.
